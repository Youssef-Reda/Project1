### Telehealth Remote Medical Diagnostic System-Based on AI and IoT

Our project aims to provide a sustainable solution for children, the elderly, and individuals who require regular primary care but lack access to nearby or high-quality healthcare providers. We built a robust and portable device that could perform more than Six Medical Checkups integrated with a Cloud and AI system, capable of classifying 31 different diseases through 14 models. Then, a mobile application connects the patient with the appropriate physician virtually to diagnose and prescribe the required meds.

We attempted to integrate the device with the latest technologies, including heart rate measurement, Oxygen saturation monitoring, a Contactless thermometer, a Digital Otoscope, and a Digital Stethoscope for heart and lung auscultation, as well as high-accuracy deep learning models for pre-diagnosis.

### 💻 To build that system, we used various technologies, methodologies, libraries, frameworks, and tools like:
* Python; Scikit-Learn for building AI models and programming the Raspberry pi.
* Tensor flow / Colab; for developing and training the AI models.
* Google Dialog flow; for building and deploying the chatbot.
* Django; for designing and developing the website.
* Fusion 360; for designing and 3D printing of device prototype.
* Flutter; for designing the cross-platform smartphone application.
